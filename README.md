# What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual representation of a user interface (UI) that outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a website or application. It serves as a blueprint, focusing on content placement, navigation, and user flow without incorporating detailed design elements like colors or typography.

# Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

## Clarifies Structure & Layout

Wireframes help designers and stakeholders visualize the skeletal framework of a product, ensuring alignment on key components before investing in high-fidelity designs.

## Improves User Experience (UX)

By mapping out user interactions early, wireframes identify potential usability issues, allowing for refinements before development begins.

## Saves Time & Resources

Catching structural flaws at the wireframing stage reduces costly revisions later in the design or development phases.

## Facilitates Collaboration

Wireframes act as a communication tool between designers, developers, and clients, ensuring everyone has a shared understanding of the projectâ€™s direction.

## Focuses on Functionality First

By stripping away visual distractions, wireframes prioritize usability and content hierarchy, leading to more intuitive designs.
